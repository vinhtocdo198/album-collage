# Personal Album Collage

Compilation of my favorite album covers into a frame, just because I like and I was too idle during work. Written in python (Remember to install Pillow using `pip install pillow`). 

## Usage

- Step 1: Open spotify in full screen mode and the target album -> click onto the album cover -> run `extract_cover.py` to extract the cover into png. Change the image name for each album.

- Step 2: Run `draw_collage.py` to compile the album covers together into a collage. Change the grid row and column as needed.
