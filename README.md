# Personal Album Collage

Compilation of my favorite album covers into a frame, just because I like and I was too idle during work. Written in python. 

## Usage

Open spotify in full screen mode and the target album -> click onto the album cover -> run [extract_cover.py] to extract the cover into png. Change the image name for each album.
